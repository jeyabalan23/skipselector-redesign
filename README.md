# 🚛 Skip Selector Redesign

A modern, mobile-responsive React application that fetches skip hire options using a live API and presents them in a user-friendly card-based UI. This redesign maintains the core functionality of the original [WeWantWaste](https://wewantwaste.co.uk) page while improving its UI/UX and responsiveness.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React** (via Vite)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Fetch API** to retrieve live skip data
- **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop

---

## 📦 Features

✅ Fetches real-time skip data from:
```

[https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32\&area=Lowestoft](https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft)

```

✅ Displays skip options in a clean, modern card layout  
✅ Fully responsive: works great on **mobile** and **desktop**  
✅ Clear call-to-action for skip selection  
✅ Error handling for API requests
